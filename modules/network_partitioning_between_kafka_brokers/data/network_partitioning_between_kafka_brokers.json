  "description": "This incident type refers to a situation where there is an issue with the communication between Kafka brokers due to network partitioning. A network partition is a situation where a network is split into two or more parts, and communication between them is disrupted. This issue can lead to data inconsistency, loss of messages, delayed message delivery, and other related problems. As a result, it is important to quickly detect and resolve these incidents to prevent any downstream impact on the system.",
